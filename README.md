## Why?
If you download [WRB](https://cutt.ly/wrb) through Thunderstore, you also have to download every dependency it has which aren't actually necessary but are "forced" for user experience. (Every mod except R2API) This mod aims to circumvent the unnecessary dependencies for specialized needs or for modpacks.

## Other features

## Stealing downloads?
This mods uses the thunderstore API to download and update the mod(s), so it shouldn't steal any downloads. at least in theory.
